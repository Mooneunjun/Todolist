# Todolist


##Update

Added a date display to the program header, which shows the current date in a user-friendly format.

Implemented a checkbox feature for each to-do item, allowing users to mark completed tasks with a visual indicator.

Included a delete button for each to-do item, which allows users to remove individual items from their list.

Updated the layout of the to-do list to make it more visually appealing, including strikethrough styling for completed items and a centered display for mobile devices.

Thank you for your continued support and feedback, and please don't hesitate to reach out with any further suggestions or issues.

### I am dissatisfied with the project I have been working on, as it has very limited functionality and a poor design. I plan to rebuild a more practical and user-friendly to-do list in the future.

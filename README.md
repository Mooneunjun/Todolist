Update

We are excited to announce the latest update to our program, which includes several new features and improvements based on user feedback. Here are some of the key changes:

Added a date display to the program header, which shows the current date in a user-friendly format.

Implemented a checkbox feature for each to-do item, allowing users to mark completed tasks with a visual indicator.

Included a delete button for each to-do item, which allows users to remove individual items from their list.

Updated the layout of the to-do list to make it more visually appealing, including strikethrough styling for completed items and a centered display for mobile devices.

Thank you for your continued support and feedback, and please don't hesitate to reach out with any further suggestions or issues.
